    <h2 class="artist">by Roger Waters</h2>

    <p class="verse">
        Reached back for the bottle<br>
        And rubbed against the lamp<br>
        Genie came out smiling<br>
        Like some Eastern tramp<br>
        He said hey boy what's happening<br>
        What is going on<br>
        You can have three wishes<br>
        If you don't take too long
    </p>
    <p class="verse">
        I said well<br>
        I wish they were all happy in the Lebanon<br>
        Wish somebody'd help me write this song<br>
        I wish when I was young<br>
        My old man had not been gone<br>
        Genie said consider it done
    </p>
    <p class="chorus">
        There's something in the air<br>
        And you don't know what it is<br>
        You see someone through the window<br>
        Who you've just learned to miss<br>
        And the road leads on to glory but<br>
        You've used up your last wish<br>
        Your last wish<br>
        And you want her to come home<br>
    </p>
